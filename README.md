using std::cpp 2019
-------------------

Presentation from Joaquín Mª López Muñoz at [using std::cpp 2019](http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2019/)
and associated material.

* Some fun with Reactive Programming in C++17: Reactive Programming models program behavior as a directed
graph of data dependencies where state changes propagate through callbacks. We introduce the main concepts
of RP and some motivational examples through the construction of an RP microframework in C++17 using
[Boost.Signals2](https://www.boost.org/doc/html/signals2.html).
