Presentation from Joaquín Mª López Muñoz at [using std::cpp 2019](http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2019/)
and associated material.

* [Some fun with Reactive Programming in C++17](https://github.com/joaquintides/usingstdcpp2019/raw/master/Some%20fun%20with%20Reactive%20Programming%20in%20C++17.pdf) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YljMM3y0qE)):
Reactive Programming models program behavior as a directed
graph of data dependencies where state changes propagate through callbacks. We introduce the main concepts
of RP and some motivational examples through the construction of an RP microframework in C++17 using
[Boost.Signals2](https://www.boost.org/doc/html/signals2.html).
